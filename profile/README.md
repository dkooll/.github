Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Devops Engineer with a preference to develop and use infrastructure as code principles. Spending all my time
building cloud solutions in Azure using both declarative and imperative approaches. Enthusiastic about everything
serverless, to minimise operations, so the primary focus will be mainly on development.

I also like to blog and write about the challenges and solutions i encounter along the way.

Some keywords to describe my personality: eager to learn, thinker, ambitious, impatient, accurate
strong feeling of responsibility.
