### Welcome ðŸ‘‹  

I am a DevOps Engineer with a strong preference for developing and using infrastructure as code principles.  
I specialize in building cloud solutions in Azure using both declarative and imperative approaches.  

My primary focus is now on development, though I have a long history in operations as a sysadmin.

I enjoy blogging and writing about the challenges and solutions I encounter along the way.  

Some keywords to describe my personality: eager to learn, thinker, ambitious, impatient, accurate  
strong feeling of responsibility.  

### Interrests:
terraform, bicep, pulumi, CI/CD, powershell, docker, kubernetes, go, python, lua, rust
